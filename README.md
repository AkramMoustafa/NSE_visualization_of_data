# Fluid Flow Visualization

This GitHub repository uses two animations for visualization of data. Model is still under training and will be added in this repository very soon.

Data is represented in a 2 dimensional space. The data shows waterflow through a cylandir. The youtube video shows an example of waterflow.

**Data Source:**  
Data was extracted from the following GitHub repository:

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

### Animated Quiver Plot of Fluid Velocity

-Animated Quiver Plot of Fluid Velocity
-This visualization displays how fluid motion evolves over time by plotting velocity vectors (u, v) at each grid point
-A quiver plot is generated for each time step over a 100x50 mesh, illustrating both the direction and magnitude of flow
-The resulting animation is exported as a GIF for dynamic analysis of the fluid's behavior

### Heatmap of Pressure Over Time

-Heatmap of Pressure Over Time
-Chart creates a 2-dimensional pressure map with dimensions 100 (x-axis) Ã— 50 (y-axis) = 5000 spatial points
-The output is saved as a GIF showing how pressure changes across the domain over time
